## The one-paragraph version

Valkyrie is a template. The plumbing every desktop application needs is done: an embedded PocketBase mounted on the Wails
asset server so files are served from the UI's own origin, a generic job queue with persistence, bounded concurrency,
cancellation and live event push, an encrypted secret store, a debug console, and the build tooling for every platform. The
application supplies one thing: a `jobs.Runner` that does the work. Everything else keeps working.
