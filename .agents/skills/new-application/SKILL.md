  that the whole pipeline works end to end before any feature work starts.
  Use when the user asks to start a new project from this template, to

# New application

Take the template to a working new application. The goal of this skill is a running app that submits a job and gets a result
back — nothing more. Features come after that.

## Ground Rules

- **Copy the repository; do not re-create it.** The build tooling, the CI and the tests are the parts that take the longest to
  get right.
- **The queue is generic; the runner is yours.** The domain belongs in `internal/runner/`, never in `internal/jobs/`.
- **Do not add a dependency before the first job works.** The template ships with three runtime dependencies on purpose.
- **Keep the checks green at every step.** A broken baseline makes every later failure ambiguous.

## 1. Copy and rename

```bash
cd /home/peter/GolandProjects
git clone https://github.com/incurl/valkyrie.git <name>
cd <name>
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/incurl/<name>.git
```

Rename the identifiers. The blunt version, followed by a careful review:

```bash
grep -rl 'valkyrie\|Valkyrie' --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=node_modules \
  --exclude-dir=bindings --exclude-dir=dist . \
  | xargs sed -i 's/valkyrie/<name>/g; s/Valkyrie/<Name>/g'
```

Then review the diff. The bundle identifier becomes `com.incurl.<name>`, which is usually right, but a real product may want a
different domain. Check these by hand:

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| The module path | `go.mod` |
| The bundle identifier | `build/config.yml`, `build/darwin/Info.plist`, `build/ios/Info.plist` |
| The product name | `build/config.yml`, `internal/bindings/service.go` (`AppName`) |
| The description | `build/config.yml`, `internal/bindings/service.go`, `frontend/index.html` |
| The app name in the UI | `frontend/src/app/App.tsx` |

Regenerate the derived assets, because the config file says they come from it:

```bash
PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH" wails3 task common:generate:icons
PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH" wails3 task linux:generate:dotdesktop
```

## 2. Establish a green baseline

Before writing a line of application code, prove the template works:

```bash
gofmt -l internal/ main.go main_test.go tools/     # must print nothing
go vet ./internal/... .
go test -race ./internal/... .
go run ./tools/e2e-check
cd frontend && npm install && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build && cd ..
python3 tools/license-audit.py
PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH" wails3 build
```

Every one of these must pass. If something fails, fix it **before** writing the application: a broken baseline makes every
later failure ambiguous.

Then run the binary and click through it once:

```bash
./bin/<name>
```

Submit a job, watch it move through the queue, cancel it, retry it, delete it. The queue is the heart of the application.

## 3. Write the first runner

Create `internal/runner/<yourname>.go`. Start with the simplest thing that can work — a stub that returns a fixed result — and
grow it into the real backend call.

**`internal/runner/example.go` is a compiled, tested reference.** Copy it rather than writing from scratch, so the API cannot
drift under you:

```bash
cp internal/runner/example.go internal/runner/myapp.go
```

Then edit it. The three things it demonstrates are the three things every runner must do:

```go
func (r *MyRunner) Run(ctx context.Context, job jobs.Job) (*jobs.Result, error) {
    // 1. Honour the context, so that cancelling the job stops the work.
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done():
        return nil, ctx.Err()
    default:
    }

    // 2. Read the credentials in Go. The frontend never sees them.
    apiKey, found, err := r.settings.GetAPIKey()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    if !found {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("no API key is configured. Add one in Settings.")
    }

    // 3. Return a *jobs.Error when you want to attach a numeric code
    //    the UI can branch on.
    if err := r.callTheAPI(ctx, apiKey, job.Prompt, job.Params); err != nil {
        return nil, &jobs.Error{Code: 42, Message: "the API refused the request", Err: err}
    }

    return &jobs.Result{Payload: map[string]any{"answer": "ok"}}, nil
}
```

Register it in `main.go`, replacing the echo runner:

```go
jobManager := jobs.NewManager(
    pbService.App(),
    jobs.WithEmitter(bridge),
    jobs.WithLog(consoleLog),
    jobs.WithRunnerFunc(func() jobs.Runner {
        return runner.NewMyRunner()
    }),
)
```

**Honour `ctx`.** It is the only way a cancelled job stops. A runner that ignores it keeps a slot in the bounded queue, and
every later job waits behind it.

## 4. Make the parameters real

The job params are a `map[string]any`. The frontend sends them; the runner receives them. Give them a shape and validate it on
both sides.

The frontend side — a panel in `frontend/src/features/`:

```tsx
const [model, setModel] = useState('default');
// ...
submitMutation.mutate({ prompt, params: { model } });
```

The backend side — validate in the runner, not in the service:

```go
model, _ := job.Params["model"].(string)
if model == "" {
    model = "default"
}
```

**Validate in the runner.** The service is a thin adapter; the runner is where the domain rules live.

## 5. Add the settings

If the application needs a credential, it is already wired:

- `internal/pocketbase/settings.go` — `SetAPIKey`/`GetAPIKey` and `SetBaseURL`/`GetBaseURL` are there.
- The settings dialog already has the fields.
- The secret is encrypted and write-only from the UI's point of view.

Rename the setting keys if they are not generic enough:

```go
const (
    SettingAPIKey = "app.api_key"
    SettingBaseURL = "app.base_url"
)
```

The frontend only ever learns whether a key is present (`has_api_key`). Never return the key itself.

## 6. Update the end-to-end check

`tools/e2e-check/main.go` is the fastest end-to-end signal. It currently exercises the stub runner. Point it at your runner
and assert what your application actually produces:

```go
job, err := manager.Submit(context.Background(), jobs.Request{
    Title:  "a test job",
    Prompt: "a red bicycle",
    Params: map[string]any{"model": "default"},
})
// ...
if received.Prompt != "a red bicycle" {
    fmt.Printf("   FAIL: the runner received %q\n", received.Prompt)
    os.Exit(1)
}
```

## 7. Decide what the scaffold keeps

The scaffold ships panels that show the plumbing. As the application grows, some of them stop earning their place:

| Panel | Keep it when |
| --- | --- |
| Submit | Always — it is the entry point. |
| Queue | Always — the job lifecycle is the core. |
| Console | While you are debugging the backend. It is genuinely useful in production too. |
| Settings | While the application has settings. |

Delete a panel by removing its directory and its use in `frontend/src/app/App.tsx`. Do not leave dead imports: the TypeScript
build has `noUnusedLocals`, so it will fail rather than let them slide.

## 8. Verify and commit

```bash
gofmt -l internal/ main.go main_test.go tools/
go vet ./internal/... .
go test -race ./internal/... .
go run ./tools/e2e-check
cd frontend && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build && cd ..
python3 tools/license-audit.py
PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH" wails3 build
```

Commit the rename and the first runner as two commits, so the rename stays reviewable:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "chore: rename the template to <name>"
git add internal/runner/ main.go && git commit -m "feat: the <name> runner"
```
