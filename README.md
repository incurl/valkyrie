# Valkyrie

A desktop application scaffold: **Wails v3** + **PocketBase** + **Vite** +
**React**, wired together and ready to be built on.

It is a template, not a product. The plumbing — the embedded database, the
job queue, the event bridge, the debug console, the build and packaging
tooling, the test setup — is done, so that a new project starts from a
working application instead of an empty folder.

## What is in the box

| Piece | Where | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Job queue | `internal/jobs/` | Persistence, scheduling, cancellation, status transitions, events |
| Runner | `internal/runner/` | **The extension point.** The scaffold ships an echo runner; replace it |
| Embedded database | `internal/pocketbase/` | Bootstrap, migrations, settings, encrypted secrets |
| Wails services | `internal/bindings/` | The API the frontend calls |
| Debug console | `internal/console/` | An in-memory log of the application traffic, shown in the UI |
| React shell | `frontend/src/` | A working three-column layout with the queue, the console and the settings |

The frontend talks to the backend **only** through the Wails bindings. It
never talks to PocketBase or to a remote API directly.

## Requirements

| Tool | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Go | 1.26+ | `toolchain go1.26.10` is pinned in `go.mod` |
| Node | 20+ | |
| Wails CLI | v3.0.0 | `go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@v3.0.0` |
| Linux build deps | gtk4, webkitgtk-6.0, gcc | `pkg-config` must find them |

> The Wails v3 CLI binary is **`wails3`**, not `wails`, and the project
> configuration is **`build/config.yml`**, not `wails.json`.

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Install the Wails v3 CLI
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@v3.0.0

# 2. Install the frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# 3. Run the app in development mode
wails3 dev
```

`wails3 dev` starts the Vite dev server, regenerates the bindings and
rebuilds the Go backend on every change.

To build a distributable binary:

```bash
wails3 build      # → bin/valkyrie
```

The [Task](https://taskfile.dev) wrappers are the ones to reach for when
you want to package:

```bash
task build            # a production binary for the host platform
task package          # the platform packages (deb, rpm, AppImage, dmg, nsis)
task run              # build and run
task build:server     # a headless HTTP server binary
task build:docker     # a minimal container image
```

## Making it yours

### 1. Rename it

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| The module path | `go.mod` |
| The product name | `build/config.yml`, `build/*/Taskfile.yml`, `internal/bindings/service.go` |
| The bundle identifier | `build/config.yml`, `build/darwin/Info.plist`, `build/ios/Info.plist` |
| The frontend name | `frontend/package.json` |

The `APP_NAME` variable in the root `Taskfile.yml` drives the binary name
and the package names.

### 2. Write your runner

The queue is generic. A job carries a title, a prompt, an arbitrary set of
parameters and an arbitrary result, and the work is delegated to a
`jobs.Runner`:

```go
type Runner interface {
    Run(ctx context.Context, job Job) (*Result, error)
}
```

Replace `internal/runner/echo.go` with your own:

```go
// MyRunner talks to the remote API.
type MyRunner struct {
    settings *pocketbase.SettingsStore
    log      *console.Log
}

func (r *MyRunner) Run(ctx context.Context, job jobs.Job) (*jobs.Result, error) {
    apiKey, found, err := r.settings.GetAPIKey()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    if !found {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("no API key is configured. Add one in Settings.")
    }

    // The context is cancelled when the user cancels the job: honour
    // it, so that the job stops promptly.
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done():
        return nil, ctx.Err()
    default:
    }

    result, err := callTheAPI(ctx, apiKey, job.Prompt, job.Params)
    if err != nil {
        // A *Error carries a numeric code, which the UI can branch on.
        return nil, &jobs.Error{Code: 42, Message: "the API refused the request", Err: err}
    }

    return &jobs.Result{
        ArtifactIDs: result.ArtifactIDs,
        Payload:     map[string]any{"answer": result.Answer},
    }, nil
}
```

Then register it in `main.go`:

```go
jobManager := jobs.NewManager(
    pbService.App(),
    jobs.WithLog(consoleLog),
    jobs.WithRunnerFunc(func() jobs.Runner {
        return runner.NewMyRunner(settings, consoleLog)
    }),
)
```

The queue, the persistence, the cancellation, the events and the history
all work the same way, whatever the runner does.

### 3. Extend the schema

The schema lives in `internal/pocketbase/migrations/`. Add a migration
with a **later timestamp** than the ones already applied — the list is
sorted by file name, so the name is the ordering key:

```go
func init() {
    registerMigration("1732000000_add_notes.go", func(app core.App) error {
        collection, err := app.FindCollectionByNameOrId("jobs")
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        if collection.Fields.GetByName("notes") != nil {
            return nil // already applied
        }
        collection.Fields.Add(&core.TextField{Name: "notes"})
        return app.Save(collection)
    })
}
```

### 4. Extend the frontend

`frontend/src/features/` holds one panel per concern. Add yours next to
them and wire it into `frontend/src/app/App.tsx`.

The generated bindings are plain JavaScript with JSDoc types. They are
re-exported behind a strongly typed surface in `frontend/src/bindings/`,
so the components never import a generated file directly.

## Data

Everything lives in `pb_data/` next to the executable:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `pb_data/data.db` | The SQLite database (3 collections) |
| `pb_data/storage/` | The uploaded and generated files, served by PocketBase's native file route |
| `pb_data/.valkyrie_key` | The AES-256-GCM key for the secrets (mode 0600) |

Set `VALKYRIE_DATA_DIR` to relocate it.

## Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `jobs` | The job metadata: the prompt, the parameters, the status, the result, the errors |
| `artifacts` | The files a job produced or consumed, with their metadata |
| `app_settings` | The encrypted secrets and the preferences |

All writes go through the Go services: the `create`, `update` and `delete`
rules are closed, so the frontend can only read. PocketBase's own rules,
migrations, file fields and hooks are used as-is.

## Secrets

The API key is write-only from the UI's point of view. It is encrypted
with AES-256-GCM before it is written to the database, and the key is
generated on first run and kept in a `0600` file inside the data
directory. The `app_settings` collection has no public list or view rule,
so the Go backend is the only reader. The UI only ever learns whether a
key is present.

The debug console shows a fingerprint of the key, never the key itself.

## Server mode

The same binary runs headless, with no GUI dependencies:

```bash
task build:server
WAILS_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 WAILS_SERVER_PORT=8080 ./bin/valkyrie-server
```

It serves the frontend and the PocketBase API over HTTP. A minimal
container image is built with `task build:docker`.

## Tests

```bash
go test ./...                    # the queue, the schema, the settings, the console
cd frontend && npm test           # the zoom, the queue helpers, the console
python3 tools/license-audit.py    # no copyleft dependency
go run ./tools/e2e-check          # a live end-to-end run of the backend
```

The end-to-end check runs the whole pipeline without a GUI: it applies the
schema, submits a job, runs the stub runner, stores an artifact and
fetches it back through PocketBase's file route.
